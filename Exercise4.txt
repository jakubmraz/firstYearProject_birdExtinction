ChatGPT says:

The outlier in each end of the scale can have a significant impact on the results. They can affect the measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) and the spread of the data (standard deviation and range).

However, it is important to keep them in the dataset for several reasons.

Firstly, outliers can provide important information about the distribution of the data. They can indicate the presence of unusual or extreme values, which can be valuable for understanding the range and variability of the data. For example, in this dataset, the outlier for the Peregrine species indicates that it has a significantly lower average time until extinction than other species, which could be due to specific environmental or ecological factors.

Secondly, removing outliers can result in a loss of information and a biased analysis. Outliers may represent rare but important occurrences that should not be ignored. Removing outliers can also result in a distorted view of the true distribution of the data and lead to incorrect conclusions. For example, if we were to remove the outlier for the Raven species in this dataset, we would miss the fact that it has a much longer average time until extinction than other species.

Finally, keeping outliers in the dataset can allow for more robust statistical analysis. There are methods such as robust regression or non-parametric tests that can handle outliers and provide more accurate results.

Therefore, it is important to keep outliers in the dataset and carefully consider their impact on the results. Rather than removing them, it may be more appropriate to investigate why they exist and how they may affect the analysis.


Rewrite using your own words:

Results can be significantly impacted by the outlier in each end of the scale. Outliers can also affect the measures of the central tendency, more specifically mean, median and mode. Moreover, they can also affect standard deviation and range - the spread of the data.

We believe that is is vital for us to keep the outliers in the dataset for various reasons:

1. Outliers provide important information about the data distribution. To be more specific, they can indicate the presence of extreme or unusual values, which might be beneficial for understanding the range and variability of our data. For instance,  the outlier for the Peregrine species in this dataset indicates that it has a much lower average time until it becomes extinct than the other species. This could also be because of the specific environmental or ecological factors.

2. Preventing loss of information and biased analysis. Outliers may be representing rare but important occurrences that we should not leave out. Removing them might result in a distorted view of the true data distribution and lead to incorrect conclusions. For instance, if we decided to remove the outlier for the Raven species in this dataset, we would miss the fact that it has much longer average extinction time than the other species.

3. Allowing more robust statistical analysis. Methods such as robust regression or non-parametric tests are able to handle outliers and provide more accurate results.

We therefore think that is is inevitable to keep outliers in our dataset and carefully consider how they impact the results. Rather than removing them, it may be better to investigate why they exist in the first place and how they may affect the analysis.
